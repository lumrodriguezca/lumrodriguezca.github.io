<h1>Programming Assignment 1</h1>
<h3>Visualize Data Using a Chart</h3>
<p>
    Below I present five interesting graphs that allow us to visually analyze the information taken from <a href="https://data.giss.nasa.gov/gistemp/">here.</a>
</p>
<o>
    <li>
        On slide one you will find a <strong>bar chart</strong> that relates the variables Year (independent variable of quantitative discrete type) on the x axis and Temperature (dependent variable of continuous quantitative type) on the y axis. This chart allows us to know the average temperature in each year between 1880 and 2014.
    </li>
    <li>
        On slide number two you will find a <strong>bar chart</strong> that relates the variables Month (independent variable of quantitative discrete type) on the x-axis and Temperature (dependent variable of continuous quantitative type) on the y-axis. This chart allows us to know the monthly average temperature between 1880 and 2014.
    </li>
    <li>
        On slides 3, 4 and 5 you will find line charts that relate the variables Month on the x-axis and Temperature on the y-axis. This charts allows us to know in more detail the average temperature in the 1880s, 1890s and 1900s respectively.
    </li>

<p>
    My charts were made with Power BI, so they are dynamic, you can play with them, make some filters to find out interesting information.
